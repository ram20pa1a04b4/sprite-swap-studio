# Sprite Swap Studio

## Project Overview

Sprite Swap Studio is a web-based visual code editor inspired by MIT Scratch. It allows users to create and manipulate sprites using a drag-and-drop block-based programming interface.

## Features

- **Motion Blocks**: Move steps, turn degrees, go to coordinates
- **Looks Blocks**: Display speech and thought bubbles
- **Control Blocks**: Repeat actions multiple times
- **Multiple Sprites**: Create and manage different characters
- **Collision-Based Animation Swap**: When sprites collide, they exchange their motion blocks

## Technology Stack

This project is built with:

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite

## Development

To run this project locally:

```sh
# Install dependencies

## Usage

1. Create sprites using the sprite editor panel
2. Drag blocks from the left panel to the code workspace
3. Click the Play button to see your sprites animate
4. When sprites with motion blocks collide, their motion behaviors will swap
